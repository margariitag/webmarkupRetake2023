          <h3>Smart Stadium</h3>
          <p>During sports events, stadiums and venues are considered the best places to feel the atmosphere and
            support
            the teams you love.
            However, many fans prefer to watch games on TV now because their preferences are changing.
            Stadiums have incorporated new technologies to improve the fan experience,thanks to several sports
            tech
            startups.
            Using AI, crowd sentiment analysis quantifies how much fun attendees are having
            during the game. Drones simplify cleaning and snack delivery to the seat at the stadium.
            Further, the Internet of Things improves the smart stadium connectivity and bandwidth at the stadium
            allowing
            attendees
            to check in fast, find parking spots, or use any apps without waiting.

            <h3>Preformance Analytics</h3>
            <p>In order to enhance preformance of decision–making, the majure goal of coaches and athletes
              is to
              understand
              which actions lead to success during the game. There comes preformance analytic tools that measure
              a broad
              range of data,
              letting atletes to know which processes are in need of improvement. Nowadays the analytics are that
              improved,
              that it even provides statistics such as the position of the ball, player movements,

            <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>In short, Artificial Intelligence able to sense, think and act like a human because of
              it´s sensors
              and computer
              vision–powered cameras. They process data that they sense from the outside world,
              making the imposible
              possible. An exciting
              example is the recent partnership between Formula 1 and Amazon Web Services to re–design Formula
              1´s
              next–generation race car
              in time for the 2022 season. With the goal of improving wheel–to–wheel racing between
              cars, F1 transferred
              its simulation environment
              to AWSs high performance computing platform. This enabled the barriers of time and computing
              capacity to be
              overcome and demonstrates
              the innovative and dynamic possibilities AI is bringing to the sports industry.
