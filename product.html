          <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
          <p>Nowadays&comma; virtual reality just like AI&comma; is used to motion captures of sports movements&comma;
            so VR and AI is walking on the same &quot;path&quot; together&comma; to solve problems such as athlete
            progress tracking in an easy and fast way&period; There are many VR experiments done&comma; to detect
            deceptive
            movements in an attacking player&acute;s approaching run&period;

            <h3>Smart Bails</h3>
            <p>While watching cricket&comma; you might have noticed whenever the wicketkeeper stumps the batsman&comma;
              the bails over the stumps fall and quickly light into colorful led&period; These are actually smart bails
              that were launched In 2013 by a firm named Zing Bails&period; When the bails were properly freed from the
              stumps&comma;
              the goal was to make them glow&period; A microchip in the bails senses when touched amongst the stumps
              and the bails are lost&period; The bails are powered by a low&ndash;voltage battery&comma; which lights up
              in
              less than
              1&sol;1000th of a second&period;

              <h3>Snicko or Edge detector</h3>

                Hawk&ndash;Eye innovations&rpar;
                use sound waves to determine if the ball has contacted the bat before being captured by the
                opposition team&period; It measures sound waves with a sensitive stump microphone coupled to an
                oscilloscope&period; The sounds are then processed for background noise&comma; coordinated with video
                streams&comma;
                and played back in slow motion for the third umpire to assess a judgment&period;

                  most
                  amazing
                  one is when the camera flys and shows the view of the whole stadium or even a close shot
                  of your favourite sportsperson&period; It is all because of flying drones and spider cams that
                  are operated by TV broadcasters that offers amazing shots on our TV&period; They have a
                  360&ndash;degree
