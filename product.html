              the bails over the stumps fall and quickly light into colorful led&period; These are actually smart bails

              stumps&comma;
              the goal was to make them glow&period; A microchip in the bails senses when touched amongst the stumps
              and the bails are lost&period; The bails are powered by a low&ndash;voltage battery&comma; which lights up
              in

                use sound waves to determine if the ball has contacted the bat before being captured by the
                opposition team&period; It measures sound waves with a sensitive stump microphone coupled to an
                oscilloscope&period; The sounds are then processed for background noise&comma; coordinated with video
                streams&comma;
                and played back in slow motion for the third umpire to assess a judgment&period;
